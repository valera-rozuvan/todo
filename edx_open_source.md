## In progress ##

## To be done ##

- [ ] Add ability to register JavaScript function callbacks to be called when video updates. The idea is that you should be able to synchronize page content with a playing video.
- [ ] Finish with refactoring [i18n.js file](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/3175).
- [ ] Setup locally [edX Drupal site](https://github.com/edx/edx-mktg) and figure out how to add search to [courses page](https://www.edx.org/course-list).
